# Short Blockchain Books

## Overview

Simple web application that showcases how a website can interact with a Solidity contract pushed to the Sepolia testnet
The collection of small "books" are stored on the blockchain. Each books metadata including its title, description, content and cover image,
is fetched from a smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet. This project demonstrates the intergation of React with blockchain technology in a simple manner.
